    <!- Try building a new body here, bootstrap is a wise choice ->
    <div class="px-5 py-5 mx-auto">
        <h1 class="text-primary"><strong>Group Project Plan</strong></h1>
        <p class="text-secondary">This is the scrum plan for our group.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Program Purpose and Function: The purpose of our jeopardy spin-off project is mostly for entertainment. As for input or output, we could make the questions and have the user input the answers, then depending on whether the question was answered correctly along with other parameters (possibly time or an answer streak), the output is the given answer, whether it was correct or incorrect, the correct answer (if incorrect), and points. The way this would function is it would store the inputted answer into a variable and compare it to a variable where the correct answer is stored</li>
            <li>Data Abstraction: A list will be used to store the possible categories of questions and/or the buttons to the corresponding questions. This is given that we plan on making more question categories than will be displayed in each game. A list will also be used for the questions and the possible correct answers.</li>
            <li>Managing Complexity: Given the number of questions and number of correct answers (including potential alternates such as 4 and four and Four), configuring variables for each question and each answer is possible but impractical.</li>
            <li>Procedural Abstraction: A function will be developed with the forementioned loop in (5). Other than the loop, it will display the categories on the top row of the table of questions and put the contents of the questions on separate screens which will be accessed when the question's corresponding buttons are pressed. </li>
            <li>Algorithm Implementation: A loop will be used to cycle each category, and the access method to each question so that the question can be displayed when a corresponding space in a table is clicked.</li>
            <li>Testing: The first call of the function would be to populate the table of questions on the main page with access methods to the questions. The second call will populate the separate screens with the questions.  </li>
        </ol>
